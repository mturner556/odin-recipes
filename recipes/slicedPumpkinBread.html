    <p>A pumpkin loaf spiced with cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg. I came up with this recipe after many failed attempts at pumpkin loaf. I adapted a favorite banana loaf recipe and this was the result. Yum! This recipe yields 3 loaves. Stock your freezer! </p>

    <h2><em>Ingrediants</em></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar </li>
        <li>1 cup light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, melted </li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li>3 cups pumpkin puree </li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking soda </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>   
        <li>Mix white sugar, brown sugar, and melted butter together in a large bowl. Stir in eggs and vanilla extract; mix in pumpkin until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg, cloves, and salt together in a separate bowl. Mix flour mixture into pumpkin mixture until incorporated. Pour batter into three 5x9-inch loaf pans. Smooth batter evenly in each pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the middle of each loaf comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
